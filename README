dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.

Build Additions
-------------

My build of dmenu adds three patches already made for dmenu:

- dmenu-border (self explainatory)
- dmenu-center (centers on the screen, does not center text)
- dmenu-linehight (set height of each line of an option in dmenu)

It also changes the colorscheme a little. I don't plan to change
any other parts of dmenu currently but am looking at ways to 
center the text in the middle of dmenu and include extra info
such as install date/location.
